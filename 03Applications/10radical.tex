In this chapter, we prove there exists quintics
with roots that are not expressible using 
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and radicals. 

% Def - Cyclic Extensions.
% Thm - Classification of Cyclic Extensions.

%    -  Def - Radical Ext, Solvable by Radicals
%    -  Def - Generated Subfield
%    -  Def - Compositum
%    -  Thm - Compositum of Simple Exts is Double
%    -  Lem - Compositum of Rad Exts is Rad
%    -  Lem - Normal Closure is Compositum of Automorphed Field
%    -  Cor - 4 -> 2
%    -  Lem - Embedding of Rad Ext is Rad
%    -  Thm - Normal Closure of Rad Ext is Rad

%    -  Thm - Strong Condition for Solvability of Rad Ext

%    -  Thm - Weak Condition fo Solvability of Rad Ext

%    -  Thm - Exists Rad Ext over Gal Ext -> Gal Ext Solvable

%    -  Thm - S5 not solvable

%    -  Thm - Quintics not generally solvable by radicals
