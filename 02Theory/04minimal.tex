\begin{lem} Extensions induce Ring Morphisms on the Polynomial Ring. 

    Let $\iota_0 : K \to L, \iota_1 : L \to M$ be extensions. 
    Then we have a natural injective morphism of rings $\Bar{\iota_0} : K[X] \to L[X]$
    and $\Bar{\iota_1} : L[X] \to M[X]$ such that 
    $\Bar{\iota_1 \circ \iota_0} = \Bar{\iota_1} \circ \Bar{\iota_0}$. 
    \begin{figure}[ht]
        \centering
        \begin{tikzcd}
        K \arrow[r,"\iota_0"] \arrow[dr,"\iota_1 \circ \iota_0" below left] &
        L \arrow[d,"\iota_1"]& & 
        K[X] \arrow[r,"\Bar{\iota_0}"] \arrow[dr,"\Bar{\iota_1 \circ \iota_0} 
        =    \Bar{\iota_1}\circ\Bar{\iota_0}" below left] & 
        L[X] \arrow[d,"\Bar{\iota_1}"] \\
        & M & & & M[X]
        \end{tikzcd}
        \label{fig:polyring_functor}
    \end{figure}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
    $\Bar{\iota_0} : K[X] \to L[X], 
    \sum_{k=0}^n \la_kX^k \mapsto \sum_{k = 0}^n \iota_0(\la_k)X^k$. 
    
    (Check the composition-preserving property.)
\end{proof}
%    - Def - Evaluation Homomorphism. 
\begin{lem} Evaluation Morphism. 

    Let $K$ be a field, $a \in K$. 
    Then the \emph{evaluation at a} \[ev_a : K[X] \to K, f \mapsto f(a)\]
    is a morphism of rings. 

    Furthermore, given an extension $\iota : K \to L$, 
    we have $\iota \circ ev_a = ev_{\iota a} \circ \bar{\iota}$. 
    I.e. the following diagram commutes. 
    \begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzcd}
    K[x] \arrow[r,"\Bar{\iota}"] \arrow[d,"ev_a"]
    & L[X] \arrow[d,"ev_{\iota a}"]\\
    K \arrow[r,"\iota"]& L\\
    \end{tikzcd}
    \label{fig:ev}
\end{figure}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof} Both statements are straightforward to check. 
\end{proof}

%    - Def - Alg Element, Alg ext
\begin{dfn}
    Let $\iota : K \to L$ be a field extension and $a \in L$. 
    Then we have the ring morphism \[
        ev_a \circ \bar\iota : K[X] \to L, 
        f \mapsto (\bar\iota f)(a) 
    \]
    i.e. takes polynomials over $K$ and evaluates them at $a$ inside $L$.
    $a$ is called \textbf{algebraic over $K$} when 
    $\ker (ev_a \circ \bar\iota) \neq (0)$.
    For polynomials $g \in \ker (ev_a \circ \bar\iota)$, 
    we say \textbf{$g$ has $a$ as a root}. 
    Otherwise, $a$ is called \textbf{transcendental over $K$} when
    the kernel is instead zero. 
    
    $\iota : K \to L$ is called an \textbf{algebraic extension}
    when for all $a \in L$, $a$ is algebraic over $K$.
\end{dfn}
%    - Def - \min(a,K) 3 eqv def (min deg, irr, generates ideal) and uniqueness
\begin{dfn}
Let $\iota : K \to L$ be an extension, $a \in L$, $a$ is algebraic over $K$. 
Then there exists a unique non-constant, monic polynomial $\min(a,K)$ 
with $a$ as a root such that one of the three equivalent conditions holds:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\min(a,K)$ has minimal degree amongst other 
        non-constant polynomials with $a$ as a root.
    \item $\min(a,K)$ generates $\ker ev_{a} \circ \Bar{\iota}$. 
    \item $\min(a,K)$ is irreducible. 
\end{enumerate}
Then $\min(a,K)$ is called the \textbf{minimal polynomial of $a$ over $K$}. 
\end{dfn}
\begin{proof}
    Existence and uniqueness satisfying condition (1) and/or (2) is given by
    $K[X]$ being a PID. 
    
    ($2 \imp 3$)
    $\min(a,K)$ being irreducible is equivalent to it being prime,
    which is equivalent to $K[X]/(\min(a,K))$ being an integral domain.
    Since $\min(a,K)$ generates $\ker(ev_a \circ \bar\iota)$, 
    we have via the 1st isomorphism theorem for rings, \[
        K[X]/(\min(a,K)) \iso \im (ev_a \bar\iota) \leq L
    \]
    A subring of an integral domain is clearly also integral, hence we are done.
    
    ($3 \imp 2$)
    Let $f$ be some other polynomial in $\ker(ev_a \circ\bar\iota)$.
    Then by irreducibility, 
    \[\min(a, K) \mid f \text{ or } (\min(a,K),f) = 1\]
    Suppose $(\min(a,K),f) = 1$. 
    Then by evaluating everything at $a$, we get $1 = 0$ inside $L$,
    which is a contradiction since $L$ is a field. 
    Hence, $\min(a,K)$ divides all polynomials in $\ker(ev_a \circ \bar\iota)$,
    i.e. generates the kernel.
\end{proof}
\begin{rmk}
    From the motivating example in the first section of the book, 
    we know that for a simple extension $K(a)$ ought to look like
    polynomials in $a$ over $K$. 
    The following theorem proves this.
\end{rmk}
%    - Thm - K(a) = K[a] i.e. Simple Ext iso to Quotient by Min Poly
\begin{thm} The Form of Simple Extensions by Algebraic Elements.

    Let $\iota : K \to L$ be a field extension and 
    $a \in L$ be an algebraic element over $K$. 
    Then $K(a) = (ev_a \circ\bar\iota)K[X]$.
    I.e. $K(a)$ looks like polynomials over $K$ evaluated at $a$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    Clearly $(ev_a\circ\bar\iota) K[X] \subseteq K(a)$.
    To show the other inclusion, let us recall that
    $K(a)$ is defined as the smallest field containing $\iota K$ and $a$.
    $\iota K$ and $a$ are clearly inside $(ev_a\circ\bar\iota) K[X]$,
    so we only need to prove that it is a field.
    
    Using the 1st isomorphism theorem, we get \[
        (ev_a\circ\bar\iota) K[X] \iso K[X]/(\min(a,K))
    \]
    The irreducibility of $\min(a,K)$ implies that 
    for all polynomials $f$ in $K[X]$, $\min(a,K) \mid f$ or 
    $\al \min(a,K) + \be f = 1$ for some polynomials $\al, \be$.
    Projecting everything to the quotient $K[X]/(\min(a,K))$ shows that
    every element in the quotient is either 0 or unit.
    The quotient is thus a field and we are done. 
\end{proof}
%    - Ex - Deg Ext = Deg Min Poly
\begin{ex} The Degree of Simple Extensions over Algebraic Elements.

    Let $\iota : K \to L$ be a field extension and 
    $a \in L$ be an algebraic element over $K$. 
    Show that $[K(a):K] = \deg \min(a, K)$. 
    (Hint: You now know $K(a) \iso K[X]/(\min(a,K))$.)

Some equivalent conditions for an element to be algebraic.
%    - Lem - K(a) fin iff a alg
\begin{lem}
    Let $\iota : K \to L$ be a field extension and $a \in L$. 
    Then the following are equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $a$ is algebraic over $K$
        \item $K \to K(a)$ is a finite extension
        \item $K \to K(a)$ is an algebraic extension.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
    ($1 \imp 2$)
        The previous result.
        
    ($2 \imp 3$)
        Let $[K(a):K]$ be finite, $b \in K(a)$.
        Then $K(b)$ is a subfield of $K(a)$ containing $\iota K$. 
        So by the Tower Law, we have $[K(b):K]$ finite as well.
        Here is the trick. 
        $\{b^k\}_{k \in \N}$ is a subset of vectors in $K(b)$.
        Since $[K(b):K] = \dim_K K(b)$ is finite, 
        $\{b^k\}_{k \in \N}$ cannot be linearly independent. 
        Thus there is a finite $K$-linear combination
        of powers of $b$ equal to zero. 
        This is clearly just a polynomial over $K$ 
        with $b$ as a root!
        
    ($3 \imp 1$)
        Trivial.
\end{proof}
%    - Lem - L/K fin -> L/K Alg
\begin{thm} Finite Extensions are Algebraic.

    Let $\iota : K \to L$ be a finite field extension. 
    Then it is an algebraic extension.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    Let $a \in L$. Then $K(a)$ is a subfield of $L$ containing $\iota K$.
    Hence by the Tower Law, $[K(a) : K]$ is finite,
    which implies $a$ is algebraic by the previous lemma. 
\end{proof}
\begin{rmk}
    The fact that all finite extensions are algebraic means that
    as far as we are concerned, we do not have to worry about
    elements not being algebraic.
