% This example is the original one Kenny showed us.

What follows is a simple example of the \emph{Galois correspondence},
the central result upon which Galois theory is built. 
We assume the reader is familiar with the notion of groups, subgroups,
dimension of vector spaces, linear maps and subspaces.

Consider $\R$, the set of real numbers.
We can do basic arithmetic 
with addition and multiplication in $\R$,
as well as divide by non-zero elements. 
Objects of this form are called \emph{fields}.
With the basic arithmetic operations, 
we can form equations of unknowns and ask for their solutions.
The simplest of such equations are \emph{polynomial equations},
i.e. asking for roots of a polynomial. 
One famous example is $X^2 + 1$.
It has no roots in $\R$.
However, we can artificially add in a root, called $i$,
to \emph{extend} $\R$ to some larger field that 
does contain a root of $X^2 + 1$.
This is what the field of complex numbers $\C$ is. 
$\R$ then injects into $\C$.
This is an example of what we call a \emph{field extension}. 

The way in which $\R$ injects into $\C$ is not arbitrary. 
If one takes two real numbers $a, b$, 
then adding them inside the reals followed by injecting yields
the same result as injecting them separately then adding inside the complex numbers.
That is to say, if we let $\iota : \R \to \C$ denote the injection,
then we have \[
    \iota(a + b) = \iota(a) + \iota(b)
\]
The same holds for multiplication. \[
    \iota(a b) = \iota(a)\iota(b)
\]
In particular, $\iota(1) = \iota(1\cdot 1) = \iota(1)^2$,
so \[
    \iota(1) = 1
\]
where the first ``1" is in $\R$ and the second is in $\C$. 
In a sense, the field structure of $\R$ is preserved when passing through $\iota$.
Thus when considering fields, 
functions satisfying the above three conditions are of interest. 
They are called \emph{field morphisms}. 

Note that $\iota$ being a field morphism gives $\C$ a real vector space structure.
The fact that every element of $\C$ is of the form $a + b i$ with real $a, b$
says $\{1,i\}$ is a basis of $\C$ as a real vector space. 

Consider the field morphisms $\sigma$ from $\C$ to itself that preserve $\R$,
which we shall call $\R$-automorphisms of $\C$. 
This is the same as $\sigma$ being $\R$-linear field morphisms.\[
    \sigma(\la z + w) = \la \sigma(z) + \sigma(w) \,\,\,\,,\, \la \in \R
\]
What could such a $\sigma$ be? 
Since $\{1,i\}$ is a basis for $\C$, 
$\sigma$ is uniquely determined by $\sigma(1), \sigma(i)$.
But $\sigma$ is a field morphism, so $\sigma(1) = 1$. 
So we only need to figure out what $\sigma(i)$ could be. 
Intuitively, we only need $\sigma(i)$ because 
the data of $\C$ only consisted of : \begin{enumerate}
    \item It is a field.
    \item It has $\R$ sitting in it.
    \item It is obtained by creating a root of $X^2 + 1$, $i$.
\end{enumerate}
Since $\sigma$ preserves the field structure of $\C$ and leaves $\R$ unchanged,
the only data left to play with is regarding $i$. 

To see what $\sigma(i)$ can be, recall that 
$i$ is a root of the real equation $X^2 + 1 = 0$.
Here is the trick : 
since $\sigma$ is a field morphism that preserves $\R$, 
this equation is \emph{also preserved},
i.e. \[
    0 = i^2 + 1 \imp 
    0 = \sigma(0) = \sigma(i^2 + 1) = \sigma(i)^2 + 1
\]
So $\sigma(i)$ is still a root of $X^2 + 1$
and hence can only be $\pm i$. 
This shows that $\sigma$ can only be either the identity function of $\C$
or complex conjugation. 

Both the identity function and complex conjugation are invertible functions,
with inverses that are also $\R$-automorphisms of $\C$. 
This means the set of all $\R$-automorphisms of $\C$ forms a group
under function composition. 
This is called the \emph{Galois group of the extension $\R \to \C$},
denoted $\aut{\R}{\C}$.
Observe that $\aut{\R}{\C}$ is has cardinality two
and the dimension of $\C$ as a real vector space is also two.
This is one part of the Galois correspondence.

Next, consider the fields inside $\C$ that contain $\R$.
These fields also extend $\R$, but are in $\C$, 
so they are called \emph{subextensions of $\C$}.
Let $L$ be a subextension. What could $L$ be?
Since $L$ contains $\R$, it is also a real vector space,
in fact a real subspace of $\C$. 
The dimension of $L$ is less than or equal to the dimension of $\C$. 
But the dimension of $\C$ is 2, so the dimension of $L$ can only be 1 or 2,
i.e. $L$ is either $\R$ or $\C$.
Observe that since $\aut{\R}{\C}$ is a two element group, 
the number of its subgroups is also 2. 
So the set of subextensions of $\C$ has the same cardinality as 
the set of subgroups of its Galois group.

In fact, we can give an explicit bijection between the subextensions and subgroups.
For a subextension $L$, 
let $\aut{L}{\C}$ denote the group of $L$-automorphisms of $\C$.
This is a subgroup of the Galois group $\aut{\R}{\C}$.
For a subgroup $G$ of $\aut{\R}{\C}$,
let $\C^G$ be the set of all compelx numbers fixed by all elements of $G$.
This is a field inside $\C$ containing $\R$, i.e. a subextension of $\C$.
One can verify that these are inverse functions of each other
and thus they give a bijection between 
the subextensions of $\C$ and the subgroups of its Galois group.
Furthermore, the bijection reverses inclusions.

    \aut{\R}{\C}
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{figure}
This is the Galois correspondence for the case of the extension $\R \to \C$. 

The general Galois correspondence is as follows. 
\begin{thm} Basically Galois Correspondance. 
    
    Let $\iota_L : K \to L$ be a ``nice" field extension.
    \footnote{
        i.e. there are conditions for the Galois correspondence to hold,
        which we do not have the language to describe yet.
    }
    
    Let $E \subseteq L$ be a subextension of $L$. 
    Then the group of $E$-automorphisms of $L$ is
    a subgroup of the Galois group of $L$. \[
        \aut{E}{L} \leq_\Grp \aut{K}{L}
    \]
    Let $G$ be a subgroup of the Galois group of $L$. 
    Then the subfield fixed by $G$, $L^G$, is a subextension of $L$.
    \[ K \overset{\iota_L}{\to} L^G \]
    
    The following are true :  
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item (Inverses)
            For a subgroup $G$ of $\aut{K}{L}$ \[
                G = \aut{L^G}{L}
            \]
            For a subextension $E$ of $L$, \[
                E = L^{\aut{E}{L}}
            \]
            Hence, we have a bijection between subextensions of $L$
            and the subgroups of the Galois group of $L$.
            
            \begin{figure} [H]
                \centering
                \begin{tikzcd}
                \{G \mid G \le \aut{K}{L}\} 
                \ar[r, "L^-", rightharpoonup, 
                start anchor=north east, end anchor=north west, yshift = -5] 
                \ar[r, "\aut{-}{L}" below=2, leftharpoondown, 
                start anchor=south east, end anchor=south west, swap, yshift = 7]
                &  \{E \mid K \to E \subseteq L\} \end{tikzcd}
            \end{figure}
            
            \item (Order Reversing) 
            Let $G, H \leq \aut{K}{L}$ be subgroups such that $G \subseteq H$.
            Then \[ L^H \subseteq L^G \]
            Similarly, 
            let $E, F \subseteq L$ be $K$-subextensions such that $E \subseteq F$.
            Then \[ \aut{F}{L} \subseteq \aut{E}{L} \]
        \item (Degree) 
            Let $E$ be a subextension of $L$. 
            Let $[E : K]$ denote the dimension of $E$ as a vector space over $K$
            and $[\aut{K}{L} : \aut{E}{L}]$ denote the subgroup index of $\aut{E}{L}$.
            Then $[E : K] = [\aut{K}{L} : \aut{E}{L}]$. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{thm}
We call the above the ``basically" Galois correspondence because
as the reader will see, the correspondence is quite an elaborate one,
relating many other properties of field extensions to properties of groups.
