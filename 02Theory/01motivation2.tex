Let $L$ be a field. 
Its algebraic structure consists of 
addition and multiplication. 
A symmetry of $L$ as a field is then defined as 
a bijective map $\sigma : L \to L$ such that 
addition and multiplication is preserved, i.e. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\forall x, y \in L, \sigma(x + y) = \sigma(x + y)$.
    \item $\forall x y \in L, \sigma(x y) = \sigma(x) + \sigma(y)$. 
    \item $\sigma(1) = 1$. 
\end{enumerate}


Let $G$ be a finite set of symmetries of $L$ as a field,
that is to say, 
let $G$ be a finite subgroup of the group of
