We now present a short chapter on the Primitive Element theorem,
which states that finite separable extensions are in fact simple extensions.

\begin{thm} Primitive Element.
    %From Milne's Galois theory notes
    
    Let $\iota_L : K \to L$ be a finite separable extension. 
    Then there exists an element $a \in L$ such that $L = K(a)$. 
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    We split into cases of $K$ being a finite set and an infinite set. 
    The finite case is dealt with later. 
    
    Let $K$ be an infinite set. 
    There exists a finite set of generators $S$ of $L$ as a $K$-extension.
    We proceed by induction on the number of generators. 
    Assume finite separable $K$-extensions with $|S|-1$ many generators 
    can all be written as simple extensions. 
    Then WLOG $L = K(a, b)$. 
    Let $c = a + \la b$ for some $\la \in K$. 
    We have the following situation. 
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \begin{tikzcd}
        K \arrow[r,"\iota_L"] &
        K(c) \arrow[r,"\subseteq"] &
        K(a,b) = L
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{figure}
    We claim there exists a $\la$ such that $K(c) = L$. 
    Let $(N,\iota_N)$ be the normal closure of $(L,\iota_L)$
    with $a_0,\dots,a_n$ and $b_0,\dots,b_m$ respectively galois conjugates of $a, b$ in $N$.
    WLOG $a_0 = \iota_N(a)$ and $b_0 = \iota_N(b)$.
    For $i \in n, 0 \neq j \in m$, the equation \[
        a_i + \la b_j = a_0 + \la b_0
    \]
    has the unique solution \[
        \la = \la_{i,j} := \frac{a_0 - a_i}{b_j - b_0}
    \]
    $\la_{i,j}$ is well-defined since $L$ separable implies $b_j \neq b_0$ for $j\neq0$.
    There are only finitely many $\la_{i,j} \in K$, so since $K$ is infinite, 
    we can pick $\la$ that is not equal to any $\la_{i,j}$. 
    We show that such a $\la$ is sufficient.
    
    Suppose $\deg\min(b,K(c)) = 1$. 
    Then $b \in K(c)$, which implies $a \in K(c)$, i.e. $L = K(c)$ and we are done. 
    On the other hand, assume $\deg\min(b,K(c)) > 1$. 
    Then $\min(b,K(c))$ divides $\min(b,K) = \min(b_0,K)$ implies
    there exists a $b_j$ galois conjugate of $b_0$ such that 
    $b_j \neq b_0$ and $b_j$ is a root of $\min(b,K(c))$. 
    Note that $\min(a,K(c)) (c - \la b) = 0$,
    so $\min(b,K(c))$ divides $\min(a,K(c)) \circ (c - \la X)$.
    Hence $b_j$ being a root of $\min(b,K(c))$ implies
    \[ 0 = \bar{\iota_N} \min(a,K(c)) (\iota_N(c) - \la b_j) \]
    i.e. $\iota_N(c) - \la b_j = a_i$ a galois conjugate of $a_0$.
    Thus, $a_i + \la b_j = \iota_N(c) = a_0 + \la b_0$ for $j \neq 0$, a contradiction. 
    This completes the proof. 
    
\end{proof}

\begin{rmk}
    The above proof shows that primitive elements of a finite separable extension
    $K(a_0,\dots,a_{n})$ are of the form \[
        c = a_0 + \la_1 a_1 + \cdots + \la_n a_n
    \]
    where $\la_i$ are appropriate elements in $K$. 
    We will come back to computations of primitive elements 
    after developing the Galois correspondance.
